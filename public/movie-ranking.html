<h1>The Best Movies According to Amanda</h1>
<h2>My 3 favorite movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Moulin Rouge</h3>
<p>Romantic, tragic, and a musical. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are perfectly casted in this film, and Baz Luhrmann's vibrant take on the story is magical.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>The perfect wrap-up to a groundbreaking movie series. The battle scene when everyone arrives to take down Thanos is *chef's kiss*.</p>

<h3>Django Unchained</h3>
<p>One of the few 3-hour movies that I didn't want to end. Powerful storytelling, incredible acting, and a gripping plot.</p>
